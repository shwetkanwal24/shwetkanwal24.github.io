	<h1><strong><u><center>In China but where: Conspiracy theory on how coronavirus began makes comeback</center></u></strong><h1>
    <u>
</u></h1>
<p><img src="images/big-img3.jpg" width="800" height="500">Despite China's frantic attempts to pin the blame of the novel coronavirus pandemic on the United States or Italy, the theory that Covid-19 originated in an animal and seafood market in Chinese city of Wuhan has held steady. Well, some new doubts are being raised over this narrative, making it a theory that's going to be subject to more intense scrutiny in coming weeks and months.
</p><p>Scientists are largely in agreement that the novel coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2, came from bats just like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. Sars-CovV-2 is now infecting humans and hence has become a human virus. But how the novel coronavirus journeyed from bats to human is a question that's yet to be settled.</p>
<p>Based on previous experiences of coronavirus outbreaks, scientists have assumed that the novel coronavirus must have travelled through an intermediary animal or animals. That the novel coronavirus easily travels between animal species is confirmed from the fact that a cat and a tiger too have tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>The dominant (not scientifically proven) theory is that novel coronavirus reached humans through pangolin, which is known as the most illegally traded mammal in the world for meat and its scales.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00364-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>this report published in the Nature</strong></a> recorded that pangolin was not in the inventory of the items being sold in Wuhan's Huanan meat market. Some people have pointed out that this omission of pangolins from being listed for sale could be due to the legal ban on the animal's trade. They argue that the mammal could have been traded in the market illegally.</p>
<div></div>
<p>But there is another problem with the theory of the Huanan market being the origin of the novel coronavirus outbreak. This theory flowed from studies sponsored by China, whose credentials for transparency are not widely recognized as credible.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>study published in The Lancet</strong></a> analysed first 41 Covid-19 patients and concluded that 27 of them had exposure to the Huanan animal market. This made health experts believe (in the absence of concrete scientific proof) that the novel coronavirus reached humans from Huanan animal market.</p>
<p>But the same study reported that the first recorded person to have been infected with the novel coronavirus did not have exposure to that market. This is a crucial piece of information that consolidates doubt over the Huanan animal market origin theory for coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>study published in the Nature</strong></a> journal busted the social media myth that pangolins were the definitive intermediary of the novel coronavirus. One of the authors, <a href="https://twitter.com/edwardcholmes/status/1246237549556686848?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Edward Holmes took to Twitter</strong></a> to declare that the "intermediate host [is] still uncertain".</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25731" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>research paper</strong></a> concluded on the basis of a genome study of the SARS-CoV-2 that pangolins could not have been the source of coronavirus outbreak. This study was also sponsored by China.</p>
<p>Moreover, the scientists have found that for a new virus, coronavirus has shown almost no evolution in the three months of infecting humans. Usually, viruses evolve after becoming a human virus.</p>
<p>This shows that novel coronavirus was well-adapted to human body when it broke into their system. This also signals that novel coronavirus might have been in human environs in Wuhan for quite some time.</p>
<p>Earlier, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/conspiracy-theories-abound-on-how-wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak-happened-1641197-2020-01-29" target="_blank"><strong>a conspiracy theory</strong></a> that generated much curiosity on social media said the novel coronavirus was a bio-weapon that escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, China's only Level-4 virus research centre.</p>
<p>This is situated only 25-30 km from the Huanan wet animal market, which the Chinese very soon declared as the source of the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for scientists, the Chinese authorities cleaned up the animal market pretty quickly after the outbreak leaving the entire scientific community to speculate on the source of origin of Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
